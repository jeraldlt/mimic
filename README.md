# Mimic Emulator

*Mimic is in early stages of development and will likely be broken*

The Mimic Emulator is a basic embeddable platform for working with virtual microcontrollers.

Currently, Mimic is being used to support teaching the MIPS32 platform, so a basic MIPS32 assembler and emulator is all that is included.

*Note that even these basic features are incomplete and missing support for many instructions*

In the future, I would like to support other platforms such as RISC-V and AVR (and maybe ARM, though there is no shortage of ARM development-focused emulators). I would also like to include a GUI IDE-like environment (much like MARS for MIPS or MPLAB for ARM).
